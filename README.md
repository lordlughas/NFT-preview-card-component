## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

This is project challenge was really challenging for me. I am happy to have concluded this challenge.
I learned a lot while practising this. I learned how to apply color to hover state image, adding svg file 
to code. I also learned how to effectively style elements while refactoring my codes.


### Continued development

I would continue practise to master the act of changing color of hover state on image. The overlay technique worked perfectly after several trial and adjustment.

### Useful resources

- Resource 1: (https://w3schools.com) - This website helped me in understanding and performing the hover state color on the image. Also, in several areas as adding svg files and others.

- Resource 2: (https://developer.mozilla.com) - I am always grateful for mdn assists me in all areas i get hooked as i go about my coding. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
